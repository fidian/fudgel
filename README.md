Fudgel
======

Want to investigate web components but don't like the amount of overhead needed to add and remove elements? Feel like making a custom element that can work with any framework, yet shudder when you think of the heavy lifting that's required to automatically update text shown in the browser? Need a reason to reduce the amount of code overhead while still feeling a sense of relief when you realize that other tools are doing the majority of the work?

Introducing Fudgel: Write less code. Do more.

This lightweight (about 4k minified and gzipped) library gives you many of the powerful features of today's frameworks without the annoyance of the bulk. No build system is required; you can write plain JavaScript. This fully supports tree shaking, TypeScript, and augmentation as your needs grow.

For detailed information and examples, check out the [documentation site](https://fudgel.js.org). Offline? Hopefully you were able to install dependencies with `npm install` while you were online, then use `npm run start` to let you view the documentation locally.
