            <h1>Lifecycle Methods and Hooks</h1>
            <p>
                If your controller has any of these methods, they will be called
                during specific moments during the lifecycle of your controller.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>onInit()</code> is called after the custom element is
                connected to a DOM. It's a good place to set up your initial
                properties. Child elements are not yet attached to the DOM,
                templates are not parsed, and most other things are not yet set
                up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>onViewInit()</code>, if you have one, will be executed at
                the very end after the custom element is connected to the DOM.
                At this point, all children are in the DOM,
                <code>#ref</code> directives are set up, and your element is
                basically live.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>onChange(propertyName, oldValue, newValue)</code> will be
                triggered whenever a monitored property is updated. Monitored
                properties are the ones that are referenced in a template.
                Differences are detected by using <code>===</code> (strict
                equals), so changes to immutable objects trigger change
                detection more easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>onDestroy()</code> is when the controller is being
                detached from the custom element and the custom element is being
                disconnected from the DOM.
            </p>
