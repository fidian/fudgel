            <h1>Lifecycle Methods and Hooks</h1>
            <p>
                If your controller has any of these methods, they will be called
                during specific moments during the lifecycle of your controller.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>onInit()</code> is called after the custom element is
                connected to a DOM. It's a good place to set up your initial
                properties. Child elements are not yet attached to the DOM,
                templates are not parsed, and most other things are not yet set
                up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>onParse()</code> is fired when all child nodes are parsed.
                If you are doing your own content transclusion, this would be an
                important method to use. With lengthy HTML, there might be
                multiple chunks of child nodes added as children to the custom
                element. This method is called after all of them are added,
                using a technique of watching for the document's content to be
                loaded and using a mutation observer to see if any parents have
                next siblings.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>onViewInit()</code> will be executed at the very end after
                the custom element is connected to the DOM and the template has
                also been attached and processed. At this point, all children
                are in the DOM, <code>#ref</code> directives are set up, and
                your element is basically live.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>onChange(propertyName, oldValue, newValue)</code> will be
                triggered whenever a monitored property is updated. Monitored
                properties are the ones that are referenced in a template, plus
                any attribute or property listed in the config. Differences are
                detected by using <code>===</code> (strict equals), so changes
                to immutable objects trigger change detection more easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calling <code>update()</code> (see
                <a href="utilities.html">Utilities</a>) will also call
                <code>onChange()</code> for all attributes and properties that
                are copied into the controller.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>onDestroy()</code> is when the controller is being
                detached from the custom element and the custom element is being
                disconnected from the DOM.
            </p>
