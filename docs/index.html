            <h3>
                A lightweight web component library that eliminates pain and
                boilerplate.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Learning new technologies, tooling, and techniques constantly is
                an annoyance. Staying on the bleeding edge of technology can be
                painful. Why keep learning new things? Can't new things look and
                feel like traditional JavaScript and HTML? Yes, it absolutely
                can. Fudgel lets you write an HTML template and associate it
                with a JavaScript class that acts as its controller. You call
                methods from the HTML to do things in the class. Likewise,
                changes in the class are automatically reflected in the HTML.
                You don't have to manually redraw or worry about the magic; it
                just works.
            </p>
            <p>
                When given a class as a controller, Fudgel will automatically
                parse the HTML template and set up bindings to your controller's
                properties. When they change, the HTML is automatically updated.
                It also handles events, passes data as attributes and
                properties, and fully supports TypeScript. All of this is done
                while allowing you, the developer, to maintain control; add
                additional directives, hook into the component's lifecycle, and
                even handle content projection using slots.
            </p>
            <p>What do you get by using Fudgel?</p>

                    the Web Component classes and all available tools
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fully tree-shakeable, reducing your bundle size when you
                    don't use everything supplied
                </li>
            </ul>
            <code-sample
                type="js"
                live="true"
                html="<my-custom-element></my-custom-element>"
            >
                <!-- prettier-ignore -->
                <template>
                    import { component } from './fudgel.min.js';

                    component('my-custom-element', {
                        template: `
                            Hello {{this.name}}, welcome to Fudgel!
                        `
                    }, class MyCustomElement {
                        name = "Developer"

                        onInit() {
                            setTimeout(() =&gt; this.name = 'Super Developer', 5000);
                        }
                    });
                </template>
            </code-sample>
            <p>
                In the above example, a new custom element is defined. Whenever
                you use the new HTML element
                <!-- NOTE: these are not standard hyphens so word wrapping does
                    not happen -->
                <code>&lt;my‑custom‑element&gt;</code>, it will automatically
                insert "Hello Developer, welcome to Fudgel!" as text. Because of
                the timeout set up in <code>onInit</code> (a lifecycle method),
                in five seconds the text automatically changes to "Hello Super
                Developer, welcome to Fudgel!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Web components make great additions to your browser-based UI
                because they basically work everywhere. Self-contained chunks of
                functionality that can eliminate lots of work on your side.
                Also, upgrading them or upgrading your existing framework is
                easier because their dependencies are built into the custom
                element. The downside is a bit of extra size from the wiring
                that has to take place, but Fudgel limits that to just the
                necessities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is this a framework? Perhaps, depending on your definition. This
                provides the structure and removes a lot of hassle when trying
                to wire up custom elements in order to make web components. It
                does this by providing many of the features you could see in
                other frameworks, while keeping the bundle size small. Fudgel
                adds about 4k (the complete bundle, minified and compressed) to
                your assets that need to be delivered. This is extraordinaly
                small when compared to some of the more popular frameworks like
                Angular or React.
            </p>
            <fudgel-sizes></fudgel-sizes>
            <p>
                Yes, those numbers are in bytes. As a comparison, your browser
                requested just this HTML, consuming about 740 bytes. The
                response headers were about 1k and the compressed response body
                had roughly 1,375 bytes (12.5k uncompressed). It's almost unfair
                to compare this to other frameworks.

            <h2>Browser Support</h2>
            <p>
                Over 96% of today's web traffic would work with this library.
                This includes Chrome (computer and Android), Edge, Safari
                (computer and iOS), Firefox, and others. There's no support for
                Internet Explorer, QQ Browser, UC Browser for Android, or other
                really obscure or severely outdated browsers. See the detailed
                browser features required and supported browser versions and
                global usage stats at CanIUse.com for the following feature
                lists:
                <a
                    href="https://caniuse.com/?feats=mdn-html_elements_slot,template,mdn-api_customelementregistry,template-literals,mdn-api_document_createelement,mdn-api_shadowroot"
                    >custom elements</a
                >,

                    >language features</a
                >. When you do, make sure to scroll to the "Summary" section and
                select "Intersection". The minimum browser version with full
                support of all of these features is Chrome 74, Edge 79, Safari
                14.1, Firefox 90, Chrome for Android 120, Safari on iOS 14.5,
                Samsung Internet 11.1. There's no support for Internet Explorer
                nor UC Browser for Android, which sum to 1.3% of global traffic.

            <h2>Goals and Prior Work</h2>
            <p>
                Fudgel was designed to make a JavaScript and HTML developer feel
                comfortable quickly. It does the heavy lifting by automatic
                bindings and updates while the developer focuses entirely on the
                interactions. The focus is to create self-contained web
                components using <code>window.customElements</code>, suitable
                for inclusion on any project.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project has received the benefit of having others blaze
                trails in this area. There's ideas from many other projects as
                well.

                    <a href="https://slimjs.com/">Slim.js</a> provided the
                    starting point that a lightweight library can contain lots
                    of functionality, such as the automatic bindings and text
                    parser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> has similar
                    lifestyle hooks and structural directives.

                    <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine.js</a> has event
                    handlers using <code>@</code> prefixes and modifiers.

                <li>
                    <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> is big into using
                    slots for content projection, plus they also have event
                    handlers with modifiers.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <p>
                Do not register your custom element in your exported module.
                That does not allow other developers to resolve conflicts. If
                your custom element is named "heading-bar" and another library
                uses the same named element, the conflict is unable to be worked
                around. Instead, export a function that allows another developer
                to prefix your element and any other custom elements you
                require.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, you want your element to accept data into the
                controller using attributes (strings) and properties (any data).
                Attributes have universal support, where as most support
                properties. When you need to send data out of your controller,
                send an event.
