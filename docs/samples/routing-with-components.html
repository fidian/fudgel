<!-- Wrapping in a template fixes issues -->
<app-router>
    <template>
        <div path="/replace" component="my-component">
            Replaces this div with the component.
        </div>
        <div path="/embed">
            <my-component>
                Works as expected.
            </my-component>
        </div>
        <my-component path="/direct">
            Also works as expected.
        </my-component>
    </template>
</app-router>

<!-- This example does NOT WORK how you want -->
<app-router>
    <div path="/replace" component="my-component">
        Replaces this div with the component.
    </div>
    <div path="/embed">
        <my-component>
            Instantiates the component and removes it from
            the DOM, afterwards adding clones to the DOM.
            Probably not what you want.
        </my-component>
    </div>
    <my-component path="/direct">
        Same problem as the one above.
    </my-component>
</app-router>
